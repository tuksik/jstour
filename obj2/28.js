Hello? Yes, This is Dog

We should all know by now what's so cool about using prototype: we can define a method for a class, and any instance of the class (i.e., object created using that class's constructor) can use that method.

Remember that classes and the prototype are important to OOP!
Instructions

Add the sayHello method to the Dog class by extending its prototype.

sayHello should print to the console: "Hello this is a [breed] dog", where [breed] is the dog's breed.

*/

function Dog (breed) {
    this.breed = breed;
};

// add the sayHello method to the Dog class 
// so all dogs now can say hello
Dog.prototype.sayHello = function(){
    console.log("Hello this is a "+this.breed+" dog");
};

var yourDog = new Dog("golden retriever");
yourDog.sayHello();

var myDog = new Dog("dachshund");
myDog.sayHello();
