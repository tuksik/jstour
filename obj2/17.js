Marching Penguins

Let's say we're dealing with a lot of Penguins. It sure would be nice to create a Penguin class so that perhaps later we can give it some methods unique to a penguin and not confuse it with the Animal class.
Instructions
---
Create a brand new Penguin class constructor starting in line 11. 
A penguin is an animal so it should also have the name and numLegs properties 
as well as a sayName method that prints the same thing as Animal's sayName method.

We're not done with animals yet, so we have still included the Animal constructor
and its sayName method. The last two lines test your Penguin code.

*/
function Animal(name, numLegs) {
    this.name = name;
    this.numLegs = numLegs;
}
Animal.prototype.sayName = function() {
    console.log("Hi my name is " + this.name);
};


// create a Penguin constructor here
function Penguin (name,numLegs){
    this.name = name;
    this.numLegs = numLegs;
};

// create a sayName method for Penguins here
Penguin.prototype.sayName = function() {
    console.log("Hi my name is " + this.name);
};

// our test code
var theCaptain = new Penguin("Captain Cook", 2);
theCaptain.sayName();
